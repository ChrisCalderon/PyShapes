PyTurtle3D
==========

Simple 3d graphics using the turtle module.

To see a demo, run `python shapes.py` in a terminal (or console if you are in Windows). If you have the `pygame` module installed, then you can run `python shapes_pygame.py` file, which is about twice as fast on my MacBook Pro.

If you think this is cool or useful, give me a tip in any amount of Dogecoin! It would make me super happy, and it would cost you next to nothing AND show your appreciation! It's a win-win!
