PyTurtle3D
==========

Simple 3d graphics using the turtle module.

To see a demo, run `python shapes.py` in a terminal (or console if you are in Windows).

Dependencies: The only thing you need to install inorder to use this is Python itself! Just make sure that you keep the `vector` module in the same directory as the `shapes` module.

If you think this is cool or useful, give me a tip in any amount of Dogecoin! It eould make me super happy, and it would cost you next to nothing, and show your appreciation!
